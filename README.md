A Comparative Assessment of Routing for Mobile Networks
Proc. WIMOB2010 - 6th IEEE International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications

Abstract
Wireless mobile devices are becoming increasingly prevalent in society. As a result, aggregation of network 
connectivity through the use of mobile networks is becoming increasingly relevant to service providers as well as 
for mobile users. The current approach being pursued within the IETF Mobile Extensions for IPv6 (MEXT) WG, is 
based on the Network Mobility (NEMO) architecture. NEMO uses IP-in-IP tunnelling for providing mobile network 
capability on an existing IPv6 network. This approach can result in non-optimal routing between source and 
destination nodes. Other proposals such as OptiNets extend NEMO and try to address issues such as sub-optimal 
routing. There are alternative approaches also being proposed, such as the Identifier Locator Network Protocol 
(ILNPv6), which is based on the use of naming, to enable a flexible and integrated mobile network capability based 
on IPv6. We have conducted a comparative analysis of the cost of providing optimal routing, in terms of packet 
and bandwidth overhead, based on an emulation, using data from the London Circle Line metropolitan railway as a 
scenario. Our analysis shows that these different approaches to mobility offer significantly different performance 
trade-offs in routing for mobile networks, depending on the constraints of the network scenario.
